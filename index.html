      <h2>Welcome! My name is Alex.</h2>
      <p>I am much like everyone else here, an aspiring software developer</p>
      <p>who currently lives in Dallas, TX. </p>

      <p>Here's what I hope to accomplish:</p>
      <div>
        <ul class="wrapper">
          <li>To gain knowledge and understanding of a user's needs and execute them through code.</li>
          <li>Start a fulfilling career doing something that I enjoy.</li>
          <li>Be as detail-oriented as I can to write high quality code.</li>
        </ul>

      <h2>About Me:</h2>
      <p>In the year 2019, I was living in Milwaukee, Wisconsin and I started going to college for Software Engineering
        at
        while working at Starbucks. All was good until the pandemic started in 2020, everything became hectic and
        my grades started to fall, so I dropped out. Three years later, my boyfriend and I moved to Dallas, Texas for a
        fresh start and I decided that I should
        stop letting my fear of failure keep me from doing something with my life other than working jobs I never really
        cared about. Luckily, I was able to meet a very kind neighbor at my apartment complex who introduced me to the
        idea of Thinkful. I didn't really have much to lose, so I figured I'd give it another go since I already had a
        background of coding to start with. </p>
      <p>When I was young, I used to watch my older brother play video games and sometimes he would let me play too. He
        was always good with technology and I couldn't help but be fascinated watching him put together his first PC.
        From there on, my interest in technology flourished.</p>
      <p>My passion for web development is evergrowing. I love the idea that each webpage is made from a group of people
        who each have their own piece of a puzzle. I'm always for hearing everyone's ideas too.</p>
